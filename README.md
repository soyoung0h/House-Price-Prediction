# House-Price-Prediction

For this project, I utilized advanced regression techniques in machine learning to predict house sales prices based on variables like overall quality, year built, total rooms above grade, and garage type. Next, I conducted data cleaning and wrangling in Python to build a random forest regressor model with the training data and an optimal n_estimator value. Last but not least, pplied the model to make predictions for over 1450 houses in the test dataset. Check out the code and results in this repository!
